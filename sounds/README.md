## Creating Your Own Sounds

You can create your own sound files by:

1. Use the 'generate-sounds.html' file in this directory to generate and download WAV files
2. Replace any of the files above with your own WAV files
3. Ensure the filenames match exactly what the game expects

Remember to keep the file sizes small for better performance.
